Branching on GitHub

In a nutshell, branching on GitHub ensures that the master code does not become broken.

A branch is created off the master like stream being diverted off the main river. In order to create a branch from GitHub Desktop, go to the top bar and find the icon which when hovered over reads "Add a Branch".  

You will want to choose a name for your new project or task, and then have it branch from master. Now, when you begin a new project in Xcode and save it onto your repository, the project will be saved only in that branch you just created. 

Later, when you have finished that project or task and have made sure it is functional, you can create a Pull Request which asks permission to the administrator to add your code to the master branch.

In this way, the administrator can look over your code and ensure that merging it will not harm the master code. 

In order to initiate a pull request, find the button in the top right corner of GitHub Desktop which when you hover over it reads "Create a Pull Request".

If it is your own repository, the administrator is you. In this case a pull request is not necessary. Therefore, you are able to merge the branch into master as you feel necessary. In order to do this, find the button next to "Add a Branch" which reads "Show Branches". Click this button and go to your master branch.

Once in the master branch, find the link in the status bar named "Branch" and select "Merge into Master...". This will merge your custom branch into your master branch.
