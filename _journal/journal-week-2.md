The past week has been full of information, and a good amount of learning as well. The problem is my current state is a negative one because the challenge is overwhelming and I'm just not understanding the material to the extent that I want and need to in order to be successful on my own.

In addition to the difficulty of the material, financial concerns and the lack of enjoyment in life is bringing me down to a point where I am less happy than I've been in months - and it's a struggle to stop this current attitude from deterring me staying engaged in the topics at hand.

I'm going to get some good sleep and rethink the issue tomorrow because today has been significantly challenging and I am tired.

Sleep always helps. Going to bed a little earlier than usual, waking up a little earlier than usual, taking a gingko and sipping a warm cup of tea - bam, ready to go. 

Things are making much more sense today then they have been in awhile. Concepts are starting to become clearer. Attitudes are becoming more positive. The overall concensus of the environment is more vibrant and collaborative. It feels better; and I am also more aware that although I am suffering fiancial difficulty currently, if I stay the course - these skills will be extremely valuable. 

My hope is that as the material makes more and more sense, the coding process will become enjoyable rather than troublesome. 

We learned some about core modeling allowing data to be stored on a server, tableview controllers both dynamic and static which can be extremely useful, a collection view controller which is similar to a tableview but slightly different, a popover view, and we even started importing other frameworks into Xcode.

There are definitely points where I am extremely confused, but overall - things are making more sense and I not only think, but feel that I am capable of becoming a software engineer.
