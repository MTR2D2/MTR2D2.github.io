The past week has been full of information and a good amount of learning is in there somewhere I imagine as well. The problem is my current state is a negative one because the challenge is overwhelming and I'm just not getting the material to the extent that I want and need to in order to be successful on my own.

In addition to the difficulty of the material, financial concerns and the lack of enjoyment in life is bringing me down to a point where I am less happy than I've been in months - and it's a struggle to stop these attitudes from deterring me from staying engaged in the topics at hand.

I'm going to get some good sleep and rethink the issue tomorrow because today has been significantly challenging and I am tired.
